# Logarithmic Time Complexity

Logarithmic time complexity (denoted as `O(log n)`). It's a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm scales as the input size increases. 

## Logarithms Explained

A logarithm is the answer to this question: X to what power equals Y?

Or, as an example: 2 to what power equals 8?

The answer is 3. So this would be expressed as: 

The logarithm is the power to which a base (the number 2 in the example above) needs to be raised: which, in our example, is 3.

This can be expressed as:

<em>log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3</em>

or

2<sup>3</sup> = 8.
