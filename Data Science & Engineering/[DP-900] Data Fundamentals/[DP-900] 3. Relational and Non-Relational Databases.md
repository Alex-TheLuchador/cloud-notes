# Relational Databases

Databases often store data as tables, with each table representing an entity like a customer, order, product, etc.

Each instance of the entity has a unique identifier called the primary key. These keys are used to reference the entity instance in another table.

For example, you may have an "order" table reference a "customer" table to identify which customer made the purchase.
