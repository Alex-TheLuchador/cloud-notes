# Data Storage

The file format used to store data depends on:
- The type of data being stored (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).
- Apps and services that need to access the data.
- If it should be readable by humans or optimized for efficient storage and processing.

## Common File Formats

As far as data engineering goes, here are some common file formats you will see.

### Delimited Text Files

- Plain text formats with field delimiters and row terminators.
- The most common format is comma-separated value (CSV).
    - CSVs have fields separated by commas.
    - Rows are terminated by a new line.
- Used by a wide range of applications.
- Human readable.

### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

- A schema used to define data entities as objects with multiple attributes.
    - Each attribute can be an object or a collection of objects.
        - For example, you could have a "Customer" object with a "Contacts" attribute.
        - The "Contacts" object/attribute can have multiple objects, such as phone number, email, and mailing address.
