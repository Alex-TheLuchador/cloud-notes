Data can be classified as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

### Structured Data

- Adheres to a strict schema.
    - The most common schema is tabular, so data is represented in tables.
        - Columns represent the attributes.
        - Rows represent each instance of a data entity.
- All data has the same attributes.
- Structured data is typically stored in a database in which multiple tables can references each other. 
    - This is called a relational model, which is an important concept to understand.

### Semi-Structured Data

    - Most customers have cell phones, others may prefer a home phone.
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a very common semi-structured data format.

### Unstructured Data
