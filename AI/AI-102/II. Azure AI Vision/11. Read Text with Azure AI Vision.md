# Read Text with Azure AI Vision
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) allows you to extract text from images and documents.

This is useful for the increasingly common task of receiving thousands of images and needing to transfer the image text to a database quickly and with a high degree of accuracy.

## Options for Reading Text
Microsoft has two options for raeding text from documents and images:
- Azure AI Vision Service
- Azure AI Document Intelligence

There is some overlap in their capabilities, but each has their own strengths.

- Image Analysis OCR (AI Vision Service):
    - Used for general, unstructured documents with smaller sections of text
    - Results are returned immediately and synchronously from an API call
    - Still has capabilities beyond OCR, as mentioned in past articles for the AI Vision Service
- Document Intelligence
    - Good for reading both small and large volumes of structured text from images and PDF documents
    - Uses document context and structure to improve accuracy
    - Initial function call returns an asynchronous operation ID which must be used in a subsequent call to retrieve results

Both services can be accessed via REST API or client library.

## Using the Read API
To use the Read OCR feature, call the ImageAnalysis function (REST API or the SDK equivalent), passing the image URL or binary data, and optionally specify a gender neutral caption or the language in which the text is writted ('en' by default).

To make an OCR request to ImageAnalysis, specify the visual feature as ``read``:
```
# Python
result = client.analyze(
    image_url=<image_to_analyze>,
    visual_features=[VisualFeatures.READ]
)

# Rest API
https://<endpoint>/computervision/imageanalysis:analyze?features=read&...
```

The results of the Read OCR function are returned synchronously, either as JSON or the equivalent language specific object.

Results are broken down into blocks (the current service uses only one block), then lines, and then words.

The text values are included at both the line and word levels, making it easier to read entire lines of text if you don't need to extract text at the individual word level.

                            }
                        ]
                    },
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Summary
When it comes to reading text from images and documents, you can pick between Azure AI Vision Service (with Image Analysis OCR) and Azure AI Document Intelligence.

To use Read OCR, call the Image Analysis function (results are returned synchronously) and pass in the image to analyze, and also specify the VisualFeature as Read.

Results are in JSON format (or the native language equivalent) and are organized first by blocks, then by lines, then by individual words.
