# Analyze Text with Azure AI Language
Azure AI Language provides an API for common text analysis techniques such as:
- Language detection
- Key phrase extraction
- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition
    - References to people, locations, time periods, organizations, etc.
- Entity linking
    - Identifying specific entities by providing reference links to Wikipedia articles

## Detecting Language
The Azure AI Language detection API evaluates text input and returns language identifiers with a confidence score. This is done for each document submitted. You can also submit a "country hint".

Language detection can work with documents or single phrases. <em>Documents must be under 5,120 characters</em> per document, and a collection of documents is limited to 1000 items (IDs). 

Here is an example of a collection of documents that could be sent to the Language service in the request body:
```
{
    "kind": "LanguageDetection",
    "parameters": {
        "modelVersion": "latest"
    },
    "analysisInput":{
        "documents":[
              {
                "id": "1",
                "text": "Hello world",
                "countryHint": "US"
              },
              {
                "id": "2",
                "text": "Bonjour tout le monde"
              }
        ]
    }
}
```
The response for the above example would be:
```
{   "kind": "LanguageDetectionResults",
    "results": {
        "documents": [
          {
            "detectedLanguage": {
              "confidenceScore": 1,
              "iso6391Name": "en",
              "name": "English"
            },
            "id": "1",
            "warnings": []
          },
          {
            "detectedLanguage": {
              "confidenceScore": 1,
              "iso6391Name": "fr",
              "name": "French"
            },
            "id": "2",
            "warnings": []
          }
        ],
        "errors": [],
        "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
    }
}
```

Things get interesting when you submit a document with multiple languages. The service will return the language with the highest representation in the document.

Example multi-language input:
```
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. ¿Se ofrecen clases en español? Es mi primera lengua y más fácil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en français?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Response for the above input:
```
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "detectedLanguage": {
                "name": "Spanish",
                "iso6391Name": "es",
                "confidenceScore": 0.9375
            },
            "warnings": []
        }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
}
```

It's also important to consider situations where the language is ambiguous, perhaps due to character encoding issues or other errors. In such cases, a response would return (Unknown) and have a confidence score of 0, like so:
```
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "detectedLanguage": {
                "name": "(Unknown)",
                "iso6391Name": "(Unknown)",
                "confidenceScore": 0.0
            },
            "warnings": []
        }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
}
```

## Extract Key Phrases
Key phrase extraction works best with larger documents, and like language detection, you can submit more than one document for analysis.

Example input:
```
{
    "kind": "KeyPhraseExtraction",
    "parameters": {
        "modelVersion": "latest"
    },
    "analysisInput":{
        "documents":[
            {
              "id": "1",
              "language": "en",
              "text": "You must be the change you wish 
                       to see in the world."
            },
            {
              "id": "2",
              "language": "en",
              "text": "The journey of a thousand miles 
                       begins with a single step."
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The response:
```
{
    "kind": "KeyPhraseExtractionResults",
    "results": {
    "documents": [   
        {
         "id": "1",
         "keyPhrases": [
           "change",
           "world"
         ],
         "warnings": []
       },
       {
         "id": "2",
         "keyPhrases": [
           "miles",
           "single step",
           "journey"
         ],
         "warnings": []
       }
],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2021-06-01"
    }
}
```

## Sentiment Analysis
Azure AI Language evaluates sentiment regarding the overall document and also individual sentences.

Sentiment is based on confidence scores for positive, negative, and neutral classifications, which each have a value between 0 and 1.

Overall document sentiment is based on sentences:
- If all sentences are neutral, the overall sentiment is neutral.
- If sentence classifications include only positive and neutral, the overall sentiment is positive.
- If the sentence classifications include only negative and neutral, the overall sentiment is negative.
- If the sentence classifications include positive and negative, the overall sentiment is mixed.

## Extract Entities
Entities are grouped into categories and subcategories. Some of them are:
- Person
- Location
- DateTime
- Organization
- Address
- Email
- URL

[A list of all categories can be found here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/named-entity-recognition/concepts/named-entity-categories?tabs=ga-api)

Entity linking can be helpful to differentiate between entities of the same name, such as Venus the planet or Venus the mythological deity. This differentiation is done by linking to an article in a knowledge base. In the case of the Text Analytics service, the knowledge base is Wikipedia.
