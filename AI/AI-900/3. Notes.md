# Neural Networks

Neural Networks are made of layers of neurons. Each layer of neurons connects to the neurons in another layer, and the connections pass data between neurons. Based on the data the neurons receive, the strength of the connections (the weight) can be adjusted.

If the data passed to a neuron meets or exceeds a certain threshold, the weight (connection) is strengthened and the data is passed along to the next layer.

A higher weight means that data has more influence on the model than other data.

When a neural network compares its current output with the desired output and adjusts weights as necessary, it is known as backpropagation.

A function called a Loss, or Cost, function determines the difference between what is desired and what was produced by the network. When the Loss is small, the network is more accurate.

Forward propagation is simply when the network is fed an input and calculates the output. 

Each cycle of forward propagation followed by back propagation is known as an Epoch.
