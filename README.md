# Cloud Notes

These notes are eternally incomplete, as I cannot write fast enough to keep up with changes in technology, and there are simply too many things to consider in the world of cloud and system design.

But I strive for completion nonetheless!

<em>These notes are heavily Azure focused.</em>
