## About
In this lab, you will uncover SSH credentials encoded in Morse code hidden inside an audio file. Privilege escalation is achieved by exploiting writable file permissions on /etc/passwd, allowing the creation of a root-equivalent user.

Utilize enumeration and web enumeration techniques to identify vulnerabilities. Engage in understanding Morse code and implement privilege escalation strategies to enhance your access. This lab is designed to capitalize on your skills in vulnerability exploitation.

After completion of this lab, learners will be able to:
- Perform service enumeration to identify open ports and accessible directories.
- Analyze the discovered audio file to extract hidden SSH credentials.
- Gain SSH access using the recovered credentials.
- Identify writable permissions on the /etc/passwd file.
- Escalate privileges by adding a root-equivalent user.
